# Coffee Machine ☕️

Welcome to the **Coffee Machine** project! This Python script simulates a interactive coffee machine experience that serves delicious beverages like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. 

## Features
- Serve three popular coffee drinks: **espresso**, **latte**, and **cappuccino**.
- Tracks resources like water, milk, and coffee.
- Handles coin-based payments with automatic change calculation.

## How It Works
- The coffee machine keeps track of its resources (water, milk, coffee beans).
- When you place an order, it checks if there's enough of each ingredient to make your drink.
- If everything's good, you insert coins, and if the payment is sufficient, it deducts the ingredients from the supplies and serves your drink!

Here’s an example interaction:

What'll it be? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): latte
Insert your coins, please!
Quarters, how many?: 10
Dimes, how many?: 5
Nickels, how many?: 0
Pennies, how many?: 0
Here's $1.0 back in change.
Here's your latte ☕. Enjoy!
